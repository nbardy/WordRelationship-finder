This is something I hacked together for a project, so the code is pretty rough shape right now.
It prints python hashs into giant javascript strings to take advantage of the fact
that python prints json looking objects.

That said the code still works and produces some pretty neat graphs.
Feel free to take this and do whatever you would like with it.

You have three modules
   relationshipFinder
    -builds a datastore from an array of strings
   scrapePurple
    -scrapes a purple chat log into an array of strings
   graphBuilder
    -builds a beautiful chart from highcharts data

highcharts.js is the chart making library used to display these graphs
